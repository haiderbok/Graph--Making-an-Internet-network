# Graph--Making-an-Internet-network
Data Structure and Algorithims Project 4

We created a Computer networks. Creating a computer graph, diving them into k which is an arbitrary number, components .
After which we created routers. Finally we were use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortedt path between any two given routers.

Concepts Included:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Kurskal's Algorithim
3. Union find
4. Graph manipulation
5. String manipulation
